### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gianfranco. I'm a recent Master's graduate in Engineering in Computer Science from Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma with experience in AI and machine learning. At the moment I am attending the School of AI offered by PI School for which I won the scholarship with 9 other fellows. I am investigating prompting and fine-tuning techniques to improve performance of Large Language Models (GPT, BLOOM,  and FlanT5) for Adaptive Machine Translation.

ðŸ“« I'm also on the hunt for a full-time machine learning role, so if you're hiring reach out! I can most easily be reached via:

 - gianfranco.romani@outlook.it
 - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gian-romani/)

You can also check and download my resume [here](resume_gianfranco_romani.pdf)ðŸ¤“

I am collecting [here](https://main--gianfree-notes.netlify.app/) the notes I am taking on AI and ML topics.
