### Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a Data Science Intern at SafEcho AG where I am working on the development of a chatbot for HSE.
I attended the School of AI offered by PI School for which I won a scholarship with 9 other fellows. I worked for Translated and investigated prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to improve the performance of LLMs (GPT, BLOOM, and FlanT5) for Adaptive Machine Translation.
I graduated with a Master's in Engineering in Computer Science from Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma.
